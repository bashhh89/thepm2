## Quick Start Guide

### What is Advanced Research?

Advanced Research is QanDu AI's guided business intelligence tool that helps you research complex topics through a structured, conversation-based approach. Unlike typical search engines, Advanced Research understands context, asks follow-up questions, and synthesizes comprehensive answers from multiple sources.

### Getting Started in 5 Steps

   Results appear in the right panel (70% of the screen):
   - Information is organized with headings and sections
   - Sources are cited where available
   - Stats and key facts are highlighted
   - Metadata shows the breadth of the search

5. **Save and Export Your Findings**
   
   ![Copy Button](https://via.placeholder.com/600x150?text=Copy+Button)
   
   - Click the "Copy" button in the upper right corner of the results panel

### Pro Tips

- **Provide Geographic Context**: Mentioning locations (e.g., "in California") improves relevance
- **Specify Industry**: Adding industry context (e.g., "in the healthcare sector") enhances results
- **Follow the Thread**: Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific aspects
- **Research in Stages**: Start broad, then use follow-ups to narrow down
